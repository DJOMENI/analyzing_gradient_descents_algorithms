# analyzing_gradient_descents_algorithms
## Aim

The aim of this practical is to implement:
- gradient descent (GD);
- accelerated gradient descent (AGD);
- coordinate gradient descent (CD);
- stochastic gradient descent (SGD);
- stochastic average gradient descent (SAG);
- stochastic variance reduced gradient descent (SVRG);

for the linear regression and logistic regression models, with the ridge penalization.
